(This game just contains the initial starting of the game's storyline as I just wanted to see how GUI works and also have a little fun instead of just learning. Will continue to work on adding more parts and elements to the game when am free. Please do feel free to ping me if you like the game or have tips to improve it. Hope you like it.)
